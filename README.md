# UE5AssetManager

This is a month-long project I worked on for my capstone team. This tool is made for Unreal Engine. It currently includes features such as mass-importing assets with pre-defined settings, distributing assets into custom created folder structures, as well as auto instancing materials for multiple static meshes at once.
